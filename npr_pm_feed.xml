      <title>What econ says in the shadows</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Economics Job Market Rumors is a website that's half a job information Wiki, where people post about what's going on inside economics departments, and half a discussion forum, where anyone with an internet connection can ask the economics hive mind whatever they want. All anonymously.<br><br>People can talk about finding work, share rumors, and just blow off steam. And that steam can get scaldingly hot. The forum has become notorious <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/03/720139562/episode-910-economics-sexism-data">for racist and sexist posts</a>, often attacking specific women and people from marginalized backgrounds.  <br><br>Last year, economist Florian Ederer and engineer Kyle Jensen discovered a flaw in the way the site gave anonymity to its users. The flaw made it possible to identify which universities and institutions were the sources of many of the toxic posts on the site. And helped answer a longstanding question that's dogged the economics profession: was the toxicity on EJMR the work of a bunch of fringey internet trolls, or was it a symptom of a much deeper problem within economics itself?<br><br><em>This episode was hosted by Mary Childs and Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Economics Job Market Rumors is a website that's half a job information Wiki, where people post about what's going on inside economics departments, and half a discussion forum, where anyone with an internet connection can ask the economics hive mind whatever they want. All anonymously.<br><br>People can talk about finding work, share rumors, and just blow off steam. And that steam can get scaldingly hot. The forum has become notorious <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/03/720139562/episode-910-economics-sexism-data">for racist and sexist posts</a>, often attacking specific women and people from marginalized backgrounds.  <br><br>Last year, economist Florian Ederer and engineer Kyle Jensen discovered a flaw in the way the site gave anonymity to its users. The flaw made it possible to identify which universities and institutions were the sources of many of the toxic posts on the site. And helped answer a longstanding question that's dogged the economics profession: was the toxicity on EJMR the work of a bunch of fringey internet trolls, or was it a symptom of a much deeper problem within economics itself?<br><br><em>This episode was hosted by Mary Childs and Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi.

      <title>A very Planet Money Thanksgiving</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Here at Planet Money, Thanksgiving is not just a time to feast on turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, green bean casseroles and pie(s). It's also a time to feast on economics. Today, we host a very Planet Money Thanksgiving feast, and solve a few economic questions along the way.<br><br>First: a turkey mystery. Around the holidays, demand for turkey at grocery stores goes up by as much as 750%. And when turkey demand is so high, you might think that the price of turkey would also go up. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176523000575">But data shows</a>, the price of whole turkeys actually falls around the holidays; it goes down by around 20%. So what's going on? The answer has to do what might be special about supply and demand around the holidays. <br><br>We also reveal <a href="https://apps.bea.gov/scb/issues/2022/02-february/0222-household-production.htm">what is counted (and not counted)</a> in the ways we measure the economy. <br><br>And we look to <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/popular-economicsciences2012.pdf">economics</a> to help solve the perennial Thanksgiving dilemma: Where should each dinner guest sit?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here at Planet Money, Thanksgiving is not just a time to feast on turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, green bean casseroles and pie(s). It's also a time to feast on economics. Today, we host a very Planet Money Thanksgiving feast, and solve a few economic questions along the way.<br><br>First: a turkey mystery. Around the holidays, demand for turkey at grocery stores goes up by as much as 750%. And when turkey demand is so high, you might think that the price of turkey would also go up. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176523000575">But data shows</a>, the price of whole turkeys actually falls around the holidays; it goes down by around 20%. So what's going on? The answer has to do what might be special about supply and demand around the holidays. <br><br>We also reveal <a href="https://apps.bea.gov/scb/issues/2022/02-february/0222-household-production.htm">what is counted (and not counted)</a> in the ways we measure the economy. <br><br>And we look to <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/popular-economicsciences2012.pdf">economics</a> to help solve the perennial Thanksgiving dilemma: Where should each dinner guest sit? Who should sit next to whom? <br><br><em>This episode was hosted by Erika Beras and Jeff Guo. It was produced by James Sneed with an assist from Emma Peaslee and edited by Jess Jiang.

      <title>The alleged theft at the heart of ChatGPT</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When best-selling thriller writer Douglas Preston began playing around with OpenAI's new chatbot, ChatGPT, he was, at first, impressed.

So, in September, they sued OpenAI for copyright infringement.<br><br>This sort of thing seems to be happening a lot lately–one giant tech company or another "moves fast and breaks things," exploring the edges of what might or might not be allowed without first asking permission.

      <title>FTC Chair Lina Khan on Antitrust in the age of Amazon</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When Lina Khan was in law school back in 2017, she wrote a law review article called 'Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,' that went kinda viral in policy circles. In it, she argued that antitrust enforcement in the U.S. was behind the times. For decades, regulators had focused narrowly on consumer welfare, and they'd bring companies to court only when they thought consumers were being harmed by things like rising prices. But in the age of digital platforms like Amazon and Facebook, Khan argued in the article, the time had come for a more proactive approach to antitrust.<br><br>Just four years later, President Biden appointed Lina Khan to be the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission, one of the main government agencies responsible for enforcing antitrust in America, putting her in the rare position of putting some of her ideas into practice.<br><br>Now, two years into the job, Khan has taken some big swings at big tech companies like Meta and Microsoft. But the FTC has also faced a couple of big losses in the courts.

      <title>Antitrust in America (classic)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Earlier this fall, the Federal Trade Commission filed a high-stakes lawsuit against Amazon.<br><br>In that suit, the FTC claims Amazon is a monopoly, and it accuses the company of using anti-competitive tactics to hold onto its market power. It's a big case, with implications for consumers and businesses and digital marketplaces, and for antitrust law itself. That is the highly important but somewhat obscure body of law that deals with competition and big business.<br><br>And so, this week on Planet Money, we are doing a deep dive on the history of antitrust. It begins with today's episode, a Planet Money double feature. Two classic episodes that tell the story of how the U.S. government's approach to big business and competition has changed over time.<br><br>First, the story of a moment more than 100 years ago, when the government stepped into the free market in a big way to make competition work. It's the story of John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil, and a muckraking journalist named Ida Tarbell.<br><br>Then, we fast forward to a turning point that took antitrust in the other direction. This is the story of a lawyer named Robert Bork, who transformed the way courts would interpret antitrust law.<br><br><em>These episodes were produced by Sally Helm with help from Alexi Horowitz Ghazi.

      <title>Cutting school... by 20%</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Right now, a lot of school districts across the country are making a pretty giant change to the way public education usually works. Facing teacher shortages and struggling to fill vacant spots, they are finding a new recruitment tool: the four-day school week.<br><br>Those districts are saying to teachers, "You can have three-day weekends all the time, and we won't cut your pay." As of this fall, around 900 school districts – that's about 7% of all districts in the U.S. – now have school weeks that are just four days long.<br><br>And this isn't the first time a bunch of schools have scaled back to four days, so there is a lot of data to lean on to figure out how well it works.  In this episode, teachers love the four-day school week, and it turns out even parents love it, too.

This dissonance is due, in part, to the difficulties of one important phase in the life cycle of a union: setting up a union in the first place. One place where that has been particularly clear is at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.<br><br>Back in 2008, Volkswagen announced that they would be setting up production in the United States after a 20-year absence. They planned to build a new auto manufacturing plant in Chattanooga. <br><br>Volkswagen has plants all over the world, all of which have some kind of worker representation, and the company said that it wanted that for Chattanooga too. So, the United Auto Workers, the union that traditionally represents auto workers, thought they would be able to successfully unionize this plant. <br><br>They were wrong.<br><br>In this episode, we tell the story of the UAW's 10-year fight to unionize the Chattanooga plant.

      <title>"Based on a true story"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When a group of amateur investors rallied around the stock for GameStop back in 2021, the story blew up the internet. News outlets around the world, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/25/960454567/cant-stop-gamestop">including us here at Planet Money</a>, rushed in to explain why the stock for this retail video game company was suddenly skyrocketing, at times by as much as 1700% in value, and what that meant for the rest of us.<br><br>When movie producer Aaron Ryder saw the GameStop story — an army of scrappy underdogs, banding together to strike back against a financial system they felt was rigged against them — he knew it had the makings for a great movie. The only problem: so did a bunch of other movie producers and Hollywood studios.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[When a group of amateur investors rallied around the stock for GameStop back in 2021, the story blew up the internet. News outlets around the world, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/25/960454567/cant-stop-gamestop">including us here at Planet Money</a>, rushed in to explain why the stock for this retail video game company was suddenly skyrocketing, at times by as much as 1700% in value, and what that meant for the rest of us.<br><br>When movie producer Aaron Ryder saw the GameStop story — an army of scrappy underdogs, banding together to strike back against a financial system they felt was rigged against them — he knew it had the makings for a great movie. The only problem: so did a bunch of other movie producers and Hollywood studios.

      <title>Is economists' favorite tool to crush inflation broken?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When economists and policymakers talk about getting inflation under control, there's an assumption they often make: bringing inflation down will probably result in some degree of layoffs and job loss.

      <title>The prince of prints and his prints of Prince</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 1981, photographer Lynn Goldsmith took a portrait of the musician Prince. It's a pretty standard headshot — it's in black-and-white, and Prince is staring down the camera lens.<br><br>This was early in his career, when he was still building the pop icon reputation he would have today. And in 1984, shortly after Prince had released <em>Purple Rain</em>, he was chosen to grace the cover of Vanity Fair. The magazine commissioned pop culture icon Andy Warhol to make a portrait of Prince for the cover. He used Lynn Goldsmith's photo, created a silkscreen from it, added some artistic touches, and instead of black-and-white, colored the face purple and set it against a red background. Warhol was paid, Goldsmith was paid, and both were given credit.<br><br>However, years later, after both Prince and Warhol had passed away, Goldsmith saw her portrait back out in the world again. But this time, the face was orange, and Goldsmith wasn't given money or credit. And what began as a typical question of payment for work, led to a firestorm in the Supreme Court. At the center of it, dozens of questions of what makes art unique. And at what point does a derivative work become transformative? The answer, it seems, has to do less with what art critics think, and more with what the market thinks.<em><br><br>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em>]]></description>

      <title>How to fight a patent pirate</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Back in the 1990s, Dr. Raghunath Mashelkar was in his office in New Delhi when he came across a puzzling story in the newspaper. Some university scientists in the U.S. had apparently filed a patent for using turmeric to help heal wounds. Mashelkar was shocked, because he knew that using turmeric that way was a well known remedy in traditional Indian medicine. And he knew that patents are for brand new inventions. So, he decided to do something about it – to go to battle against the turmeric patent.<br><br>But as he would soon discover, turmeric wasn't the only piece of traditional or indigenous knowledge that had been claimed in Western patent offices. The practice even had its own menacing nickname - <em>biopiracy</em>. And what started out as a plan to rescue one Indian remedy from the clutches of the U.S. patent office, eventually turned into a much bigger mission – to build a new kind of digital fortress, strong enough to keep even the most rapacious of bio-pirates at bay.<br><br><em>This episode was produced by Willa Rubin with help from James Sneed and Emma Peaslee.

Your diploma is waiting for you just across the stage.<br><br>But first, there's one final skill to impart: the pitch. We wouldn't be doing our job as a half-baked parody of a business school if we didn't leave you with the confidence and opportunity to stand in front of an investor and ask for money. We understand what you ambitious business school graduates really want is the chance to launch something and get rich.<br><br>So we're combining graduation with a little test of ideas, a showdown of startups, a competition of companies. We are going to put our own spin on a pitch competition like you see on Shark Tank. We hear from five listeners with real ideas for startups.<br><br>Can they make a successful pitch? What will investors be looking for in their presentation? Can they come prepared with persuasive total addressable market analyses? Who will have the sharpest customer pain points to solve? We shall see.<br><br>Our business expert will give us a rare glimpse into the mind of investors and what they're looking for. Only one graduate will be crowned the winner as this year's valedictorian. <br><br>If you want to get your diploma right now, <a href="http://npr.org/2023/08/23/1195565501/mba-summer-school-exam-quiz">take the 2023 Planet Money Summer School Quiz to earn your diploma!</a><br><br>If you share it on social media, tag us so we can celebrate with you.<br><br><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/884827691/planet-money-summer-school?"><em>Find all episodes of Planet Money Summer School here.</em></a>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The secret entrance that sidesteps Hollywood picket lines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Across Hollywood right now, writers and actors are picketing in front of studio lots. They're walking back and forth, holding up signs demanding concessions on things like pay, how many writers work on projects, and the use of AI in TV and movies.<br><br>But, on some of these lots, there are these strange <em>alternate</em> entrances where there are no picketers. Here drivers can come and go as they please without ever encountering any sign of a strike.<br><br>Behold the neutral gate. An entrance intended for people who work at these lots but <em>don't</em> work for production companies that are involved with these particular strikes. (Usually that means things like game shows or TV commercials.)<br><br>But, as one group of picketers recently experienced, it's hard to know if these entrances are, in fact, only being used by neutral parties or if the entrances might be being abused.<br><br>On today's episode, the question of whether one Hollywood production was taking advantage of the neutral gate, and what the fight over a driveway can teach us about the broader labor battles in Hollywood and across the country.<br><br><em>This episode was hosted by Dave Blanchard and Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi, with reporting from Kenny Malone.

      <title>Vacation, and why the U.S. takes so little of it</title>

Do they buy fewer, knowing that they'll sell out–and then miss out on potential revenue from papers not sold?

      <title>The new Biden plan that could still erase your student loans</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This summer, the Supreme Court struck down Biden's plan to forgive student loan debt for millions of borrowers. Except, on the same day Biden first announced that plan, he also unveiled <em>another, </em>the SAVE plan. And though SAVE sounded less significant than Biden's big forgiveness pledge, it's still alive and could erase even more student debt.<br><br>SAVE is officially a loan repayment plan. But through a few seemingly minor yet powerful provisions, many more low-income borrowers will end up paying little or nothing until, eventually, their loans will be forgiven. Even many higher-income borrowers will see some of their debts erased.<br><br>In this episode, we explain the history of income-driven repayment.

      <title>Summer School 5: Tech and the innovator's dilemma</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For anyone running a business, technology is both threat and opportunity. Today, we run through techniques entrepreneurs can use to take advantage of new tech or defend against the dangers. It's not just about the product you're selling. It's about consumer psychology, and ethics, and taking calculated risks to navigate uncertainty.<br><br>But, since this is Planet Money Summer School and we want to set your business on the path to riches, we're going to talk about how to use tech to dream big. Maybe more than anything, technology creates opportunities for the little guys where the big established companies can't be so nimble or have too much to lose. <br><br>Take the classic concept of the innovator's dilemma: a company that innovated and succeeded, now faces a choice about any disruptive new technology. Do they risk tossing out their existing advantage and switch to the new tech, or play it safe and risk becoming obsolete?<br><br>Most new technologies don't end up disrupting an industry. So it is totally rational for the big existing companies to ignore each new flash in the pan. But nobody wants to end up like Kodak: sticking with film while the digital camera takes off. So what to do? <br><br>Our friendly professor has a few ideas – for the little guy and the big old company. He'll explain the shape of how new technology gets adopted, sometimes called the S curve. We'll also hear examples of what stops promising new tech from taking off: from dishwashers to driverless cars, and even the humble elevator.]]></description>

      <title>Summer School 4: Marketing and the Ultimate Hose Nozzle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In this session of Planet Money Summer School, we are getting the word out about your brand. How do you convince consumers to buy your product, even if they are only just hearing about it? It's time for sales and marketing!<br><br>If you've watched a show like <em>Mad Men</em> or <em>The Office</em>, you know the importance of a strong pitch. It's precision-crafted to show how what you're selling can solve a problem your customer needs solved. Sometimes it even creates the need. Once you've got your sales pitch, it's time to get the word out: marketing. Where to spread that message? How to make it unforgettable? Instantly recognizable? What is going to be your <em>Just do it</em>? Your <em>Think different</em>? Your <em>Where's the beef</em>?<br><br>In our case studies today, we look at a product so cleverly marketed, the company doesn't need to market it at all anymore and customers wait years to get it: the Birkin bag. And we hear lessons from some of the world's most time tested salespeople who can and do sell <em>anything</em>, literally. It's all about the four P's: Product, place, promotion and price. Also, a few other tricks we test out. <br><br><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/884827691/planet-money-summer-school?">Find all episodes of Planet Money Summer School here.</a><br><br><em>This series is hosted by Robert Smith, and produced by Max Freedman.

      <title>Did two honesty researchers fabricate their data?</title>

We'll introduce you to the man who helped it spread around the world. He was a monk, a magician, and possibly the boyfriend of Leonardo da Vinci.<br><br>Is accounting... sexy?<br><br>Yes.

      <title>Planet Money Paper Club</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We here at Planet Money love economics papers. And that is also the case for so many of the economists we speak with.  For them, new research can explain something they have always wondered about, or make them see something they have never noticed before. And it inspires their own work. <br><br>So, to bring that same sense of discovery to you, the listener, today we are dedicating our show to a special experiment. A new way to share some of the most fascinating, clever and surprising economics papers in a segment we're calling: The Econ Paper Club.<br><br>On today's show, we read the econ papers so you don't have to. We take a joyous romp through some of the most fascinating ideas floating around economics right now. And we find that some of those fascinating ideas are about some of the biggest things in life: the careers we choose, the expectations that come with parenting and what one eminent economist calls 'greedy jobs.' <br><br><em>This episode was hosted by Erika Beras and Kenny Malone.

      <title>The quest to save macroeconomics from itself</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When it comes to big questions about the economy, we're still kind of in the dark ages. Why do some economies grow so much faster than others?

But even some macroeconomists themselves admit: While we have many theories about how the economy works, we have very few satisfying answers.<br><br>Emi Nakamura wants to change all that. She's a superstar economist who is a pioneer in the field of "empirical macroeconomics." She finds clever ways of using data to untangle some of the oldest mysteries in macroeconomics, about the invisible hand, the consequences of government spending, and the inner workings of inflation.<br><br>Recently we called her up to ask her why the economy is so difficult to understand in first place, and how she's trying to find answers anyway.

      <title>Planet Money Live: Two Truths and a Lie</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The shocks of the pandemic economy gave us a bunch of enormous natural experiments, which helped to prove or disprove conventional economic thinking.<br><br>Take, for example, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/20/1047777081/keep-calm-its-just-the-bullwhip-effect">bullwhip effect</a>, the idea that the further away from the customer you are in the supply chain, the more volatile your orders are likely to be. This theory played out at an enormous scale, in the pandemic. Consumers and companies overreacted to the risk of shortages by ordering more products and hoarding them, causing massive shifts in the supply chain – just like the theory says.<br><br>And the pandemic gave us a lot of natural experiments like this. So, on this special live edition of Planet Money, we looked for other big economic lessons from the past three years, and we took this information and turned it into... a gameshow!

      <title>Mike The Mover vs. The Furniture Police</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 1978, a young man named Mike Shanks started a moving business in the north end of Seattle. It was just him and a truck — a pretty small operation. Things were going great. Then one afternoon, he was pulled over and cited for moving without a permit.<br><br>The investigators who cited him were part of a special unit tasked with enforcing utilities and transportation regulations. Mike calls them the <em>furniture police</em>. To legally be a mover, Mike needed a license. Otherwise, he'd face fines — and even potentially jail time. But soon he'd learn that getting that license was nearly impossible.<br><br>Mike is the kind of guy who just can't back down from a fight. This run-in with the law would set him on a decade-long crusade against Washington's furniture moving industry, the furniture police, and the regulations themselves. It would turn him into a notorious semi-celebrity, bring him to courtrooms across the state, lead him to change his legal name to 'Mike The Mover,' and send him into the furthest depths of Washington's industrial regulations.<br><br>The fight was personal. But it drew Mike into a much larger battle, too: An economic battle about regulation, and who it's supposed to protect. <br><br><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em>]]></description>

      <title>Twins (classic)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Twins are used to fielding all sorts of questions, like "Can you read each other's minds?" or "Can you feel each other's pain?" Two of our Planet Money reporters are twins, and they have heard them all.<br><br>But it's not just strangers on the street who are fascinated by twins. Scientists have been studying twins since the 1800s, trying to get at one of humanity's biggest questions: How much of what we do and how we are is encoded in our genes? The answer to this has all kinds of implications, for everything from healthcare to education, criminal justice and government spending.<br><br>Today on the show, we look at the history of twin studies. We ask what decades of studying twins has taught us. We look back at a twin study that asked whether genes influence antisocial behavior and rule-breaking. One of our reporters was a subject in it. And we find out: are twin studies still important for science?<br><br><em>(Note: This episode originally ran in </em><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wshkNIJGHBQM7XSyDQ2-AbG1DP_6P_-uLFjPjHkuJc/edit"><em>2019</em></a><em>.)<br></em><br><em>Our show today was hosted by Sally Helm and Karen Duffin.

      <title>Two Indicators: The economics of innovation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Innovation is crucial for game-changing advancements in society, whether it's treatments for serious diseases, developments in AI technology, or rocket science.<br><br>Today on the show, we're airing two episodes from our daily economics show The Indicator. First, a new paper suggests that breakthrough innovations are more likely at smaller, younger companies. We talk to an inventor who left a big pharmaceutical company to start afresh, leading to some incredible treatments for serious diseases.<br><br>Then, it's off to Mars — or at least, on the way. Elon Musk's company SpaceX did a first test launch of a rocket meant to go all the way to the red planet.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Innovation is crucial for game-changing advancements in society, whether it's treatments for serious diseases, developments in AI technology, or rocket science.<br><br>Today on the show, we're airing two episodes from our daily economics show The Indicator. First, a new paper suggests that breakthrough innovations are more likely at smaller, younger companies. We talk to an inventor who left a big pharmaceutical company to start afresh, leading to some incredible treatments for serious diseases.<br><br>Then, it's off to Mars — or at least, on the way. Elon Musk's company SpaceX did a first test launch of a rocket meant to go all the way to the red planet. The rocket made it up off of the launch pad and lumbered briefly through the sky before self-destructing over the Gulf of Mexico. Suffice it to say, it's not quite ready. NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel walks us through SpaceX's business plan as we try to figure out if this company has the funding and business acumen to reach its moonshot goal.<br><br><em>These two Indicator episodes were originally produced by Corey Bridges & Brittany Cronin, engineered by Katherine Silva & James Willets, and fact-checked by Dylan Sloan & Sierra Juarez.

      <title>The town that changed economics</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the early 90s, when a young economist named Michael Kremer finished his PhD, there had been a few economic studies based on randomized trials. But they were rare. In part because randomized trials – in which you recruit two statistically identical groups, choose one of them to get a treatment, and then compare what happens to each group – are expensive, and they take a lot of time.<br><br>But then, by chance, Michael had the opportunity to run a randomized trial in Busia, Kenya. He helped a nonprofit test whether the aid they were giving to local schools helped the students. That study paved the way for more randomized trials, and for other economists to use the method. <br><br>On today's show, how Busia, Kenya, became <em>the</em> place where economists pioneered a more scientific way to study huge problems, from contaminated water to low graduation rates, to HIV transmission. And how that research changed government programs and aid efforts around the world. <br><br><em>This episode was produced by James Sneed with help from Willa Rubin.

      <title>Inflation and the Profit-Price Spiral</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Economists say that inflation is just too much money chasing too few goods.<br><br>But something <em>else</em> can make inflation stick around.<br><br>If you think of the 1970s, the last time the U.S. had really high sustained inflation, a big concern was rising wages. Prices for goods and services were high. Workers expected prices to be even higher next year, so they asked for pay raises to keep up. But then companies had to raise their prices more. And then workers asked for raises again. This the so-called wage-price spiral.<br><br>So when prices started getting high again in 2021, economists and the U.S. Federal Reserve again worried that wage increases would become a big problem.

      <title>How to fight a squatting goat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Back in 2005, Burt Banks inherited a plot of old family land in Delaware. But when it came time to sell it, he ran into a problem: his neighbor had a goat pen, and about half of it crossed over onto his property. <br><br>Burt asked the goats' owner to move the pen, but when neighborly persuasion failed to get the job done, he changed his strategy. He sued her. And that is when things got complicated.<br><br>Protecting private property is one of the fundamental jobs of the American legal system. If you hold a deed saying you own a plot of land, it's your land. End of story. Right?<br><br>But, as Burt would soon learn, the law can get really complicated when it comes to determining who <em>actually</em> owns something.

      <title>Two Indicators: the influencer industry</title>
      <description><![CDATA[When you were little, what did you want to be when you grew up? An astronaut, a doctor or maybe a famous athlete?

      <description><![CDATA[This past January, researchers uncovered that Black taxpayers are three to five times as likely to be audited as everyone else.

      <title>The life and possible death of low interest rates</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Right now, the economy is running hot. Inflation is high, and central banks are pushing up interest rates to fight it. But before the pandemic, economies around the world were stuck in a different rut: low inflation, low interest rates, low growth. <br><br>In 2013, <a href="https://larrysummers.com/">Larry Summers</a> unearthed an old term from the Great Depression to explain why the economy was in this rut: secular stagnation. The theory resonated with <a href="https://www.piie.com/experts/senior-research-staff/olivier-blanchard?gclid=CjwKCAjw8-OhBhB5EiwADyoY1VsWki-DUWa3hP2HET7U6ipsdCrW5SlMmWjIBLmedVTMY8Gi53j5rhoCRIYQAvD_BwE">Olivier Blanchard</a>, another leading scholar, because he had made similar observations himself. Larry and Olivier would go on to build a case for why secular stagnation was a defining theory of the economy and why government policies needed to respond to it. They helped reshape many people's understanding of the economy, and suggested that this period of slow growth and low interest rates was here to stay for a long time.<br><br>But today, Larry and Olivier are no longer the duo they used to be. As inflation has spiked worldwide, interest rates have followed suit. Earlier this year, Larry announced that he was no longer on the secular stagnation train. Olivier, meanwhile, believes we're just going through a minor blip and will return to a period of low interest rates within the near future. He doesn't see the deep forces that led to a long-run decline in interest rates as just vanishing. Who's right?

      <title>Two innovation market indicators</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Right now, the economy is all over the place. And when things get confusing, we look to basic economic indicators to help explain what's going on. Today, we're bringing you two episodes of our daily show <em>The Indicator</em> that focus on the bond market.<br><br>The market for U.S. treasury bonds is generally safe, predictable and pretty boring. Recently, though, it's been anything but. We look into the fluctuations in bond prices and the yield curve (one of our favorite indicators) to try to help us understand where the economy stands right now.<br><br>These two Indicator episodes were originally produced by Brittany Cronin and Noah Glick. They were fact-checked by Sierra Juarez and engineered by Gilly Moon and Katherine Silva.

      <description><![CDATA[Richard J. Lonsinger is a member of the Ponca tribe of Oklahoma, who was adopted at a young age into a white family of three. He eventually reconnected with his birth family, but when his birth mother passed away in 2010, he wasn't included in the distribution of her estate. Feeling both hurt and excluded, he asked a judge to re-open her estate, to give him a part of one particular asset: an Osage headright.<br><br>An Osage headright is a share of profits from resources like oil, gas, and coal that have been extracted from the Osage Nation's land. These payments can be sizeable - thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars a year. Historically, they were even larger – in the 1920s the Osage were some of the wealthiest people in the world.

      <title>Inside a bank run</title>

      <title>Jay &amp; Shai's debt ceiling adventure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Every year, the U.S. government spends more money than it takes in. In order to fund all that spending, the country takes on debt. Congress has the power to limit how much debt the U.S. takes on. Right now, the debt limit is $31.4 trillion dollars. Once we reach that limit, Congress has a few options so that the government keeps paying its bills: Raise the debt limit, suspend it, or eliminate it entirely. <br>That debate and negotiations are back this season. One thing that is in short supply, but very important for these negotiations, is good information. Shai Akabas, of the Bipartisan Policy Center, knows this well. Right now, he and his team are working on figuring out when exactly the U.S. government could run out of money to pay its obligations — what they've dubbed: the "X Date." <br>Shai is determined to help prevent the U.S. government from blowing past the X Date without a solution. But this year's debt-ceiling negotiations are not going very well. Which is daunting, because if lawmakers don't figure something out, the ramifications for the global economy could be huge. <br>So, how did Shai become the go-to expert at the go-to think tank for debt ceiling information? It started in 2011, back when he and current Chair of the Federal Reserve Jay Powell, armed with a powerpoint and the pressure of a deadline, helped stave off economic disaster. <br><em>Help support Planet Money and get bonus episodes by subscribing to Planet Money+ in Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org/planetmoney.</em>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A lot of the time, economic policy can seem pretty impersonal — cold, hard, data-driven.

      <title>The ice cream conspiracy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Take a look in any supermarket ice cream freezer section and you may see a mystery. There are big containers of the typical ice cream brands: Breyers, Turkey Hill, and Edy's. And there are specialty brands that make gelato, low-fat and vegan ice creams. And then there are the fancy pints: which is mostly Ben & Jerry's and Häagen-Dazs.<br><br>Häagen-Dazs has flavors like vanilla, chocolate, pistachio—the sort of flavors that run smooth. And then Ben & Jerry's specializes in chunky flavors: Cherry Garcia, The Tonight Dough, Chunky Monkey, etc. The two hardly ever cross into the other's turf. Why?<br><br>It's possible they are experiencing something common to natural competition—they are specializing in what works best for them. But, as Christopher Sullivan of the University of Wisconsin-Madison suspects, the two companies may be engaging in what is known as "tacit collusion," where two parties silently agree to... stick to their own territory.<br><br>We try to get to the creamy core of what makes up a conspiracy, and how the consumer eventually loses out in this cold, cold war.<br><br><em>Today's episode was produced by Willa Rubin and Alyssa Jeong Perry.

      <title>In defense of gift giving</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Cold economic reasoning says, supposedly, that <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/104699/original/christmas.pdf">gifts are inefficient transfers of wealth</a>. But Planet Money host Jeff Guo believes in the economic virtues of gift giving. On today's show, Jeff tries to win over Planet Money's resident Scrooge, Kenny Malone, by going on a quest to find him the perfect gift. Along the way, they're visited by the spirits of three Nobel prize-winning economic theories that can explain why gift-giving is actually good. And by the end, Kenny's heart <em>may just</em> grow three sizes larger.

      <title>Carried interest wormhole</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The carried interest tax loophole is a way that wealthy Americans – often the people who manage hedge funds or private equity firms – avoid paying billions of dollars worth of taxes. It has been one of the most controversial yet durable features of the U.S. tax code. But where did it come from? Today we romp through space and time to piece together the origins of this loophole. There will be pirates and mutiny. A 50s tax-dodge-a-palooza. And perhaps the Michelangelo of tax lawyers. | Subscribe to Planet Money+ in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/290783428">Apple Podcasts</a> or at <a href="http://plus.npr.org/planetmoney">plus.npr.org/planetmoney</a>.]]></description>

      <title>SUMMER SCHOOL 5: Car Parts, Celery &amp; The Labor Market</title>
      <description><![CDATA[You can learn a lot about a person from their job. The same can be said of an economy. The market for jobs can us a lot about how the economy is doing, but more importantly, it is where we look to see who the economy is working for, and who is left behind. In today's lesson we'll visit two workplaces each facing a different labor puzzle. At one end, there's the question of when to replace a worker with a robot, and what it is like to be that worker waiting for the robots to come. We'll also visit a farm where raising wages aren't enough to attract the workers needed to do the work.

      <description><![CDATA[It's macro time! Today: Keynes vs. Hayek. <br/><br/>Season 3 of summer school is here asking the biggest economic questions about what makes an entire economy grow or contract? Things like, is there a "right" level of unemployment? Who gains from trade? What rhymes with 'paradox of thrift'? Also, inflation, we'll get to inflation. <br/><br/>Episode 1 begins with the rise of macroeconomics as a field, with one of the great economic debates of the 20th century: what causes booms and busts, and what can the government do about it? How free should a free market be? <br/><br/>It's a debate (over beats and with an actual rap battle) between John Maynard Keynes and F.A Hayek.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@planetmoney/video/7119990664825261358?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7119593897223456302">Watch this Tik Tok</a> to learn more. | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter <a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money?utm_source=rss_feed_copy&utm_medium=podcast&utm_term=planet_money">here</a>. | Listen to past seasons of Summer School <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2naS9Y5nWSli9vi9bOvGxp">here</a>. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In 2006, Warren Buffett bet a million dollars that the most brainless, boring investment around would do better than the researched, handpicked investments of some of the smartest hedge fund managers in the world.

      <title>100 Years Since Sadie Alexander</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 1921, Sadie Alexander became the first Black person in America to receive a PhD in economics. Then, she was functionally shut out of economics jobs, got a law degree, and became an attorney instead. A century later, economics has made notably little progress bringing Black women into the field. We work with The Sadie Collective to bring you three stories from three eras of recent history that show us how the field has changed, where it still falls short, and the unique joys of being a Black woman and loving economics. | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter <a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money?utm_source=rss_feed_copy&utm_medium=podcast&utm_term=planet_money">here</a>.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Introducing an economics education for your ears! We're calling it <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/884827691/planet-money-summer-school">Planet Money Summer School</a>. It's all the economics you meant to learn, but didn't get around to. Each Wednesday, we'll serve up a Planet Money story, or selection of excerpts, paired with insights from our economists-in-residence for the summer. Get an understanding of the basic concepts of economics going to the beach. You can pick up your economics knowledge while you bike, stroll the sand or just lay in the grass. Amuse your friends.  Win arguments. Throw the words "diminishing marginal utility" into every discussion. Wednesdays in the PM feed this summer. (Fridays will be our usual coverage of the economy). <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/15/884827691/planet-money-summer-school">Start listening to the episodes here. </a>]]></description>
